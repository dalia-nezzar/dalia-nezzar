# Hello, World! :wave:

I'm Dalia, a Computer Science student at the Franche-ComtÃ© University in France. ðŸŽ“ I'm passionate about coding, like, a LOT, and love to explore the different technologies regarding web and mobile app development (for real!) :computer:

### About Me :sunglasses:

- ðŸŒ± I love to code, sing, draw, dream... Oop, my bad, thought this was LinkedIn for a second :') (I also laugh a lot)
- ðŸ˜… I admit, I _sometimes_ struggle with inspiration, but I'm always eager to learn and explore new ideas.

### Creative Designer Programmer Studenter Lover :art:

In addition to coding, I'm also a creative designer. I have a keen eye for aesthetics and enjoy designing beautiful and user-friendly websites and mobile apps. :art:

- ðŸŽ¨ A good design is not necessarly a good website, (and here I am making both)
- ðŸ’¡ I'm all in for transforming cool ideas into eye-catching digital creations. Ready to partner up and bring those concepts to life? ðŸ˜¤
